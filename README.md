 AI Roommate Project

Overview
The AI Roommate is a web application that combines an AI-powered chatbot, task management, and mood tracking into a single platform. It uses Flask for the backend, SQLite for data storage, and a modern frontend built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript.

## Features
1. AI Chatbot:
   - Interact with an AI-powered chatbot using the `distilgpt2` model from Hugging Face Transformers.
   - Real-time chat with typing indicators.

2. Task Management:
   - Add, view, and delete tasks with due dates.
   - Tasks are stored in an SQLite database.

3. Mood Tracking:
   - Track your mood (Happy, Sad, Neutral) and view mood history.
   - Visualize mood data using a bar chart powered by Chart.js.

4. Modern UI:
   - Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
   - Easy navigation between chat, tasks, and mood sections.
